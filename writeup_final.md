# Final Project: Sensor Fusion and Object Tracking

## Step 1: Implement an extended Kalman filter.

## Step 2: Implement track management including track state and track score, track initialization and deletion.

## Step 3: Implement single nearest neighbour data association and gating.

## Step 4: Apply sensor fusion by implementing the nonlinear camera measurement model and a sensor visibility check.


#### Do you see any benefits in camera-lidar fusion compared to lidar-only tracking (in theory and in your concrete results)?
#### Which challenges will a sensor fusion system face in real-life scenarios?
#### Did you see any of these challenges in the project?
#### Can you think of ways to improve your tracking results in the future?
